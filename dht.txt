There are people for whom those issues are very real, not because they chose that, but because the issues chose them (yeah, this might be a bit cheesy, but bear with me)\nI did not say anything for \"raising your voice just for raising your voice\" ... it's about \"raising your voice about concerns you have\"\nThat's important, especially for societies that claim to adhere to democratical values. Because if no one raises their voices about their concerns, there can't be a discussion about it.\n\nSo yes, it's perfectly fine for you to think they \"should just get over themselves\" and accept things they see as almost an attack on their cultural background.\nBut it's also perfectly fine for me to think you're wrong on that and should learn to not dismiss other people's issues.\n\nAnd a related matter: Yes, raising your voice on behalf of others can be a good thing, if those others' voices wouldn't be listened to. It gets iffy really easily though, once voices start to get raised \"preemptively\"\nThat's another issue though and debatable as well.\nJust as \"where is the line for 'original ethnicity of actors'\" is a valid question and one that society needs to find a consensus on, just as society needs to do that for a lot of related issues in that ... \"category\"","f":1},"271656300524470274":{"u":74,"t":1484838309175,"m":"gotta say, <@!210468057393528832>, I may not see eye to eye with you on occasion, but you have a very eloquent way of making your opinions heard.\n\nDont change."},"271656574571773952":{"u":30,"t":1484838374513,"m":"Stuff like this is what earns my respect ^^"},"271656598034841600":{"u":30,"t":1484838380107,"m":"For both of ya"},"271673257902604288":{"u":38,"t":1484842352129,"m":"Who are included in thos \"both\"? : o"},"271673388601311232":{"u":30,"t":1484842383290,"m":"Kill and TJ"},"271673455731146752":{"u":38,"t":1484842399295,"m":"<:Nebby:260873271589863426>"},"271673604851105795":{"u":30,"t":1484842434848,"m":"<:maxgasm:268038249627385856>"},"271683948667469826":{"u":19,"t":1484844901006,"m":"Imagine playing comp and getting teamed with this guy! :D\nhttp://epicstream.com/videos/Watch-Overwatch-Gamer-Do-the-Perfect-Rick-and-Morty-Impersonation","e":[{"url":"http://epicstream.com/videos/Watch-Overwatch-Gamer-Do-the-Perfect-Rick-and-Morty-Impersonation","type":"link"}]},"271685718097526784":{"u":30,"t":1484845322871,"m":"<:pogmax:268038107163525130>"},"271791309445005315":{"u":41,"t":1484870497810,"m":"<@!106515439164616704> thanks :D"},"272152228586848258":{"u":59,"t":1484956547639,"m":"any1 bored and wanna casually talk a bit?"},"272152715604525056":{"u":30,"t":1484956663753,"m":"Me *rn*","a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/171679681320452096/272152714639572992/Q.gif"}]},"272152744780103700":{"u":30,"t":1484956670709,"m":"So what's up"},"272152858365788170":{"u":59,"t":1484956697790,"m":"Not a lot tbh, trying to rank up a smurf ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"},"272152930482782208":{"u":30,"t":1484956714984,"m":"On what game"},"272152950279766016":{"u":59,"t":1484956719704,"m":"OW"},"272152989815275521":{"u":30,"t":1484956729130,"m":"Aha"},"272153002826137602":{"u":30,"t":1484956732232,"m":"Smurfs"},"272153060309204994":{"u":30,"t":1484956745937,"m":"For some reason Console is filled with smurfs lol"},"272153157621121035":{"u":59,"t":1484956769138,"m":"A dude gave me an account that I can just play to have fun on, checking how it does when I just play for fun and not care about SR"},"272153219986096128":{"u":59,"t":1484956784007,"m":"Cause my main deranked by almost 500 points by now <:moon2DUMB:230508463812247552>"},"272153274780614656":{"u":30,"t":1484956797071,"m":"I just imagine"},"272153310642044928":{"u":30,"t":1484956805621,"m":"You doing placements on there"},"272153341742809088":{"u":30,"t":1484956813036,"m":"Fucking <:grandmaster:238682706366562306>"},"272153362739494915":{"u":59,"t":1484956818042,"m":"My mains placements were .. interesting"},"272153439721750528":{"u":59,"t":1484956836396,"m":"I rekt some GM guys, then kept loosing due to team throwing cause I was unplaced"},"272153482218307585":{"u":30,"t":1484956846528,"m":"Ah"},"272153511834419201":{"u":30,"t":1484956853589,"m":"The classic unplaced bs"},"272153559028596738":{"u":30,"t":1484956864841,"m":"I remember where people on console where fucking nice to me about it"},"272153576351072256":{"u":59,"t":1484956868971,"m":"Now I just get throwers in my games, which is kinda .. making me want to kms, its really hard"},"272153587872694273":{"u":30,"t":1484956871718,"m":"It's like YEAH nice dude"},"272153604528275456":{"u":30,"t":1484956875689,"m":"It means you're good"},"272153605916721153":{"u":59,"t":1484956876020,"m":"They expect you to carry em for some reason"},"272153652318306307":{"u":30,"t":1484956887083,"m":"People on consoles are surprisingly more nice on OW"},"272153684538818563":{"u":30,"t":1484956894765,"m":"Then on PC"},"272153701928665088":{"u":59,"t":1484956898911,"m":"PC is cancer"},"272153727102746624":{"u":30,"t":1484956904913,"m":"So is console"},"272153733067177995":{"u":30,"t":1484956906335,"m":"But meh"},"272153786150158347":{"u":30,"t":1484956918991,"m":"You know what"},"272153841838063617":{"u":30,"t":1484956932268,"m":"I actually wonder if OW is ever gonna be released on the NS"},"272153868132155392":{"u":59,"t":1484956938537,"m":"I hate people who just throw because they feel like it"},"272153899941756928":{"u":59,"t":1484956946121,"m":"NS`?"},"272153906048532481":{"u":30,"t":1484956947577,"m":"Agree with that"},"272153923404562451":{"u":30,"t":1484956951715,"m":"Nintendo Switch"},"272153956455677953":{"u":59,"t":1484956959595,"m":"Oh.
